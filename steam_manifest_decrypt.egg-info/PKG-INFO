# SteamForge Fetcher (SFF)

Quick thing before we start remember to exclude the SFF folder from Windows Security or at least the folder in this path for Creaminstaller Resources to work! `sff\dlc_unlockers\resources`

SFF helps you set up games to work with Steam using Lua scripts, manifests, and GreenLuma. It writes the right files into your Steam folder so games and DLC can run. It does not replace or crack Steam itself.

**Need help?** Check the [documentation](docs/README.md) or reach out to me Merium0 on the discord and we'll sort it out.

## Quick start

Before doing anything after you install it first thing to do just to make sure everything works run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

**If you have or eant to get the EXE**  
Run simple_build.bat and after its finished run SFF.exe (adminstrator preferred to not face any idsues) and follow the prompts. You'll need GreenLuma installed; see the Setup Guide for the download link.

**If you use Python**  
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`  
2. Run: `python Main.py`  or use `simple_build.bat` to get exe instead of using python everytime.
3. Optional (Windows desktop notifications): `pip install -r requirements-optional.txt`

**GreenLuma**  
SFF works with GreenLuma. You need to download and set up GreenLuma yourself:  
(https://www.up-4ever.net/h3vt78x7jdap)

Extract the ZIP and use the AppList folder from GreenLuma when SFF asks for it. Full steps are in the [Setup Guide](docs/SETUP_GUIDE.md).

## What SFF can do

- Download and use Lua files for games, download manifests, and set up GreenLuma.  
- Write Lua and manifest data into Steam's config so games work with or without an extra injector.  
- Other features: multiplayer fixes (online-fix.me), DLC status check, cracking (gbe_fork), SteamStub DRM removal (Steamless), AppList management, and DLC Unlockers (CreamInstaller-style: SmokeAPI, CreamAPI, Koaloader, Uplay).  
- Parallel downloads, backups, recent files, and settings export/import.

## Download

- **HTTPS:** `git clone https://github.com/Midrags/SMD_2.git`
- **GitHub CLI:** `gh repo clone Midrags/SMD_2`

Then go into the project folder and see [Quick start](#quick-start) below.

**Original SMD:** SteamForge Fetcher (SFF) is modified from the original **SMD (Steam Manifest Downloader)** by **jericjan**. This version adds more features and is maintained by Midrags. SMD remains the original project.

**CreamInstaller** – The DLC Unlockers feature in SFF is inspired by and compatible with CreamInstaller. SFF does not ship CreamInstaller; it provides its own implementation that follows similar behavior.

Use SFF at your own risk.
