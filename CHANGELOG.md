# Changelog

## v4.6.4 (latest)

### New features

- **AppList profiles:** Work around GreenLuma's 130–134 ID limit by using multiple profiles. Create empty profiles, switch between them, save the current AppList to a profile, and delete or rename profiles. Each profile can hold up to 134 IDs (configurable in settings). When you reach 130 IDs, a message reminds you to create a new profile before adding more games.

## v4.6.3

### New features

- **Embedded Workshop browser:** Open Workshop from the GUI to browse Steam Workshop in an embedded web view. Login to Steam, browse workshop pages, copy links, and download items without leaving SteaMidra. Uses a persistent profile so your session is kept.
- **Workshop item download:** Paste a workshop URL or item/collection ID to download manifests. Supports single items and full collections.
- **Check mod updates:** Track workshop items and check for newer versions, then update outdated mods in one go.
- **Check for updates – automatic install:** When a newer version is available, download and update automatically. SteaMidra fetches the release, extracts it, and replaces files in your install folder.

## v4.6.2

### Removed features

- **Steam patch removed:** The Steam patch feature (xinput1_4.dll, hid.dll) has been removed from all variants.
- **Sync Lua removed:** The option to sync saved Lua files and manifests into Steam's config has been removed.
- Version bump to 4.6.2.

## v4.6.1

### Multiplayer fix (online-fix.me) – Selenium login fix

- **Login now works:** The multiplayer fix no longer uses HTTP-only login, which often failed with "Login failed (form still visible)". It now uses **Selenium with Chrome**: a headless browser opens the game page, fills in your credentials, clicks the login button, and handles cookies and JavaScript like a real browser. Login and download should work reliably.
- **What you need:** Chrome browser must be installed. Selenium is in the main requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- Search, match, download button, and archive extraction flow are unchanged; only the login step is now browser-based.

## v4.5.4

### Check for updates – automatic install

- **Automatic update:** When a newer version is available, you can choose "Download and update automatically?". SteaMidra downloads the release zip, extracts it, and replaces the files in your install folder. When running from **source** (Python), the app restarts with the new version. When running from the **EXE**, SteaMidra does not relaunch the EXE; it tells you to rebuild the EXE so the new updates take effect.
- Updates use the same folder as your current install, so no manual copying or extracting is needed.

## v4.5.3

### Multiplayer fix (online-fix.me) – correct game and better matching

- **"Game: Unknown" fixed:** The game name is now read from the ACF in the **same Steam library** where the game is installed (e.g. if the game is on `D:\SteamLibrary\...`, we read that library’s manifest, not the first one). If the name is still missing, we fetch the official name from the **Steam Store API** so we never search with "Unknown".
- **Wrong game match fixed:** Search now uses a stricter minimum match (50%) and prefers results whose link text contains the game name (e.g. "R.E.P.O. по сети" for R.E.P.O.). We also search with "game name online-fix" to narrow results. This avoids picking the wrong game (e.g. "Species Unknown" when you selected R.E.P.O.).

## v4.5.2

### Update check (Check for updates)

- **Check for updates** now works for everyone: it always checks GitHub for the latest release and shows your version vs latest.
- If you're up to date: *"You're already on the latest version."*
- If a newer version exists: you can open the release page in your browser to download (or, for the Windows EXE with a matching update package, update from inside the app).
- The updater uses proper GitHub API headers and a fallback when the "latest" endpoint is unavailable.

### DLC check reliability

- **DLC check** no longer gets stuck when Steam is slow or times out.
- Steam API requests (app info, DLC details) now retry up to 3 times with a short delay instead of looping forever.
- If Steam still fails after retries, SteaMidra automatically falls back to the **Steam Store** (no login): it fetches the DLC list and names from the store website and still shows which DLCs are in your AppList/config and lets you add missing ones.
- So the DLC check works even when the Steam client connection is flaky.

### Other fixes

- **credentials.json** is now in `.gitignore` so it never gets committed or included in release zips.
- **UPLOAD_AND_PRIVACY.md** updated with release-zip instructions and what to exclude.

## v4.5.1

### Fix for crash on startup (`_listeners` error)

**What was the problem?**

Some people got a crash when starting SteaMidra. The error said something like:  
`'SteamClient' object has no attribute '_listeners'. Did you mean: 'listeners'?`

That happened because the wrong Python package named "eventemitter" was installed. SteaMidra needs a specific one called **gevent-eventemitter**. There is another package with a similar name that does not work with SteaMidra and caused the crash.

**What we changed**

- We now tell the installer to use the correct **gevent-eventemitter** package so new installs should not hit this crash.
- If you already had the crash, do this once:
  1. Open a command line in the SteaMidra folder.
  2. Run: `pip uninstall eventemitter`
  3. Run: `pip install "steam[client]"`
  4. Run: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
  5. Start SteaMidra again.

After that, SteaMidra should start normally.
