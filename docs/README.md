# SteaMidra Documentation

SteaMidra helps you set up games to work with Steam using Lua scripts, manifests, and GreenLuma. It writes the right files into your Steam folder so games can run. It does not replace or crack Steam itself.

**What you need before using SteaMidra**

- Steam installed.  
- GreenLuma — you need to download and set it up yourself. See the [Setup Guide](SETUP_GUIDE.md) for the download link and steps.  
- A Lua file for the game (or use SteaMidra to download one).  

**Quick start**

1. Read the [Setup Guide](SETUP_GUIDE.md) to install what you need (including GreenLuma).  
2. Read the [User Guide](USER_GUIDE.md) to see how each menu option works.  
3. Use the [Quick Reference](QUICK_REFERENCE.md) for commands and shortcuts.
