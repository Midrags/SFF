# SteamForge Fetcher (SFF) Documentation

SFF helps you set up games to work with Steam using Lua scripts, manifests, and GreenLuma. It writes the right files into your Steam folder so games can run. It does not replace or crack Steam itself.

**What you need before using SFF**

- Steam installed.  
- GreenLuma — you need to download and set it up yourself. See the [Setup Guide](SETUP_GUIDE.md) for the download link and steps.  
- A Lua file for the game (or use SFF to download one).  
- On Windows you can optionally use the Steam patch so Steam reads the game data without extra tools (see Setup Guide).

**Quick start**

1. Read the [Setup Guide](SETUP_GUIDE.md) to install what you need (including GreenLuma).  
2. Read the [User Guide](USER_GUIDE.md) to see how each menu option works.  
3. Use the [Quick Reference](QUICK_REFERENCE.md) for commands and shortcuts.
