# DLC Unlockers

SteaMidra can install DLC unlockers for Steam and some Ubisoft games. That lets you use extra content (DLC) in a way that works with how the game is installed.

**How to use it**

From the main menu, choose the option that opens the DLC Unlockers or CreamInstaller-style menu. Then pick the game and the unlocker you want (for example SmokeAPI or CreamAPI for Steam games). SteaMidra will download the needed files if required and install them into the game folder. You may need to choose which DLC to unlock; the menu will guide you.

**What SteaMidra supports**

For Steam games, SteaMidra can install SmokeAPI or CreamAPI (and optionally Koaloader). For Ubisoft games it can install unlockers for older and newer Ubisoft Connect. The exact options depend on your SteaMidra version and the game.

**Credits**

The DLC Unlockers feature in SteaMidra is inspired by and compatible with CreamInstaller. Credit: CreamInstaller. SteaMidra does not ship CreamInstaller; it provides its own implementation that follows similar behavior.

**Responsibility**

Use DLC unlockers only for games and DLC you are allowed to use. SteaMidra is a tool; you are responsible for how you use it.
